# matrix-class-assignment
This project refers Matrix implementations.
We have an Matrix class and you can create an object from this class then you can use matrix functions.
### For Example
```
Scalar Matrix Multiplication
Calculation Determinant
Trace of Matrix
Two Matrix Multiplication
Calculate Matrix inverse with Gaussian Elimination Algorithm
```



### Get Started
Firstly, You need Python on your pc. Let's see how to install python your computer.
If you are using Ubuntu 16.10 or newer, then you can easily install Python 3.6 with the following commands:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

If youâ€™re using another version of Ubuntu (e.g. the latest LTS release), we recommend using the deadsnakes PPA to install Python 3.6:
```
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

# Working with Python
At this point, you may have system Python 2.7 available as well.
```
$ python
```

This will launch the Python 2 interpreter.
```
$ python3
```
